# Nike2Strava
A web based tool to export running data from Nike+ and insert it into Strava

Since Nike+ doesn't provide a convenient way to get your data out, this tool will allow a user to move all GPS based run data from Nike+ and import it into Strava.

Non gps based runs (treadmills and manually added runs) cannot be inserted into Strava but will be presented to the user in a way that allows easy manual entry.
